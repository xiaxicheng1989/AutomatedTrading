# AutomatedTrading
Trading212 doesn't really have API to automate trading procedures. I wrote a script, which uses ORC to extract trading data and control the mouse and keyboard to excuse Buy/Sell commands.

I have started building statistics on the collected data to perform some simple trading algorithms. This needs to be heavily extended.
