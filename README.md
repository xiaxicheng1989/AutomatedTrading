# Automated Trading
A day trader relies on the volatility of instruments. To maximise the profit, it is crucial to contineously monitor of the traded instruments. 

This project is my first attempt to use python to automate my own trades on Trading212. (Trading212 doesn't really have API for this purpose.)

# Methodology


I wrote a script, which uses ORC to extract trading data and control the mouse and keyboard to excuse Buy/Sell commands.

I have started building statistics on the collected data to perform some simple trading algorithms. This needs to be heavily extended.
